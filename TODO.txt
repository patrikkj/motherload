If high speed collision
use deltaTime to estimate traversed distance, 
run collision check in increments of 10% of full movement

DONE allow window resize

DONE handle simultaneous collisions

special equipment cool rocket, velocity *= 1.1 per collision, propelling away
can buy blocks to put down for stopping you at the surface at destination

before drill animation, set collidable = false
after drill animation, set material to air
